# Backlog

- HIGH PRIORITY
    - bump performance on command and event handlers
    - implement promo token for translate API
    - implement oauth state

- NOT SO HIGH
    - correctly deal with the Google Translate API translating special sequences such as links and emoji. The current solution is hacky and does not catch everything
    - ask a proper designer to make the pages
    - use bot instead of command output to display current languages
    - validate google api token before storing
    - quick dispatch to second lambda
        - requires that we make a really small dispatcher jar
