# Backlog

- HIGH PRIORITY
  - automate latest changes to API gateway !!!!!
  - implement oauth state

- NOT SO HIGH
  - correctly deal with the Google Translate API translating special sequences such as links and emoji. The current solution is hacky and does not catch everything
  - ask a proper designer to make the pages
  - use bot instead of command output to display current languages
  - validate google api token before storing
  - quick dispatch to second lambda
     - requires that we make a really small dispatcher jar
